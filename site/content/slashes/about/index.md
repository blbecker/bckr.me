I'm a software engineer in Columbus, Ohio. I live here with my wife, Rachel, a dog, and a cat. They're all pretty neat. I've lived in Columbus for quite some time now and will be [moving to San Juan, Puerto Rico](/now#moving-to-puerto-rico) soon. It's a move that I've been interested in since my first visit to the island and am very excited that it is finally happening!

I'm a hacker, in the classical sense; I'm an advocate for open-source software and open solutions in general. I find intellectual property--the ownigng of ideas--obscene. I value digital privacy and freedom. I prefer to self-host my own services and resist the dominance of Big Tech. I was a participant in the early Internet and consider this website to be my small contributing to keeping that light burning.

I'm a socialist and an activist, valuing direct action and mutual aid. I show up and I act on my beliefs. I oppose fascism and bigotry in all it's forms, supporting the liberation of all peoples.

I'm a reader. I enjoy science fiction, fantasy, and narrative history.

I'm a gamer. I enjoy board games, card games, and video games.

I'm an adventurer. I dive and I sail and I try to default to saying "Yes" to the universe.
