I'm a software engineer in Columbus, Ohio. I live here with my wife, Rachel, a dog, and a cat. They're all pretty neat. I've lived in Columbus for quite some time now and will be [moving to San Juan, Puerto Rico](/now#moving-to-puerto-rico) soon. It's a move that I've been interested in since my first visit to the island and am very excited that it is finally happening!

I'm an advocate for open-source software and open solutions in general. I find intellectual property--the owning of ideas--obscene. I value digital privacy and tend to prefer selfhosting when feasible.

I'm a socialist and an activist, valuing direct action and mutual aid. I volunteer and I act on my beliefs.

I'm a reader. I enjoy science fiction, fantasy, and narrative history.

I'm a gamer. I enjoy board games, card games, and video games.

I'm an adventurer.
