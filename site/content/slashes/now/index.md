## Doing

### Moving to Puerto Rico

My main project right now, and probably the largest I've taken on, is moving my family to Puerto Rico. I visited the island for the first time for a family vacation in 2008. I was smitten by the beautiful environment, extraordinary weather, and lively culture. Since then, moving to Puerto Rico has been a dream of mine, typically reserved for daydreams about retirement. In mid-2024, when seeking a change from my then-employer, I pursued remote work opportunities with the intention of moving... somewhere. When I found a remote job for a company headquartered in [Santurce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santurce,_San_Juan,_Puerto_Rico), my daydreams came within reach. Why wait for retirement to move to an island paradise? Our preparations are nearly complete and the adventure starts for real in June!

### Homelab

My homelab currently consists of 11 ThinkCentre Tiny PCs running Debian and k3s, a QNAP NAS, and Mikrotik routing and switching. The lab is mostly a way to learn and experiment with new technology, but I also operate services like [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin), [Mealie](https://github.com/mealie/mealie), and [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/uptimekuma/uptimekume) for myself and my family.

## Reading

### History

I'm currently reading [The Oxford History Of Greece And The Hellenistic World](https://academic.oup.com/book/51897). I've read several of the Oxford histories recently ([Medieval Europe](https://academic.oup.com/book/47840) is great) and really enjoyed them. I'm mostly familiar with the Platonic dialogs, but have really enjoyed learning a bit about Homer. Maybe I'll read some greek myths or poetry next.

### Fiction

I just finished rereading [Mona Lisa Overdrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa_Overdrive) by [William Gibson](https://bsky.app/profile/greatdismal.bsky.social). I'd read it before, but still really enjoyed it. [Sally Shears](https://williamgibson.fandom.com/wiki/Molly_Millions) is such a fun character. I haven't picked up my next fiction read yet. Maybe I'll read the next Wheel of Time book (I'm pretty sure I was last reading The Dragon Reborn, but I'm not sure that I finished it) or a continue with the [Mistborn books](https://mistborn.fandom.com/wiki/Hero_of_Ages).
