## Doing

### Moving to Puerto Rico

My main project right now, and probably the largest I've taken on, is moving my family to Puerto Rico. I visited the island for the first time for a family vacation in 2008. I was smitten by the beautiful environment, extraordinary weather, and lively culture. Since then, moving to Puerto Rico has been a dream of mine, typically reserved for daydreams about retirement. In mid-2024, when seeking a change from my then-employer, I pursued remote work opportunities with the intention of moving... somewhere. When I found a remote job for a company headquartered in San Juan, my daydreams came within reach. Why wait for retirement to move to an island paradise? Our preparations are nearly complete and the adventure starts for real in June!

### Homelab

My homelab currently consists of 11 ThinkCentre Tiny PCs running Debian and k3s, a QNAP NAS, and a Mikrotik router.
