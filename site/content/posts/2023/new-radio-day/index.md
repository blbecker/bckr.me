# New Radio!
Over the summer, my existing mobile radio--a [BTECH UV-50X3](https://baofengtech.com/product/uv-50x3/)--stopped functioning. That was mostly a bummer, I'd been pretty happy with the radio, but the promise of moving onto something a bit more capable was rather appealing. I spent the last several months researching, reading reviews, and thinking about what I wanted out of a new radio. I have quite a bit of experience with DMR, due to the availability of cheap DMR handsets, and wanted to branch out into other digital modes. I also wanted to minimize modifications to my vehicle and a remote control head to simplify installation. I ended up deciding on the [Yaesu FTM-500DR](https://www.dxengineering.com/parts/ysu-ftm-500dr).

I had to pick up a few extra install components (Yaesu _really_ wants you to screw stuff into the dash), but otherwise things could not have been simpler. I'd previously used [Anderson Powerpoles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Powerpole) when installing the older BTECH radio. As a result, swapping in the Yaesu was as simple as unclipping the leads to the BTECH and swapping them over. I spent longer on the zip ties keeping things tidy than on getting power to the radio. Within about 30 minutes, I had everything strapped into place, zip tied out of the way, and ready to get on the air.

# Handset Programming
Unfortunately, programming software for the FTM-500 is a bit limited. There's not an ADMS version available for this radio (yet?). There's software available from [RTSystems](https://www.rtsystemsinc.com/FTM-500DR_c_2403.html), but it's not open-source and was only available for Windows and Mac. I decided to try programming the radio directly from the faceplate before buying software. This has been **super** helpful. 

It's nice that the radio has a quick workflow for programming frequencies--other radios I've had would've made this quite difficult. I've become _so much_ more comfortable operating this radio after spending a couple hours plugging in repeaters, configuring preferences, and checking out wide-band receive on the VFO.

I expected to configure a repeater or two, find it slow, and use that to justify the rather minimal cost of the CPS. That's no longer my plan. Once ADMS supports the FTM-500, I expect I'll download it "just in case". I'm in no rush, though, and am enjoying getting a lot of practice.

Interestingly, I haven't spent _that much_ longer working with this radio than I might spend setting up a new DMR HT. Setting up drivers and communication between a computer and a handset is always a chore, especially if Linux tools aren't available.
