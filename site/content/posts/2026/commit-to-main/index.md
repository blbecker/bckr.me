summary: Post more by reducing friction to deploy!
---

I disabled branch protection on the main branch of the [repo](https://github.com/blbecker/bckr.me) for this website. I had been doing PRs for posts, but the friction of getting something published (and "perfecting" something before publishing it) is an impediment to hitting "post". This year, I'd like to be more intentional about building in public, both on this website and the projects that I'm tinkering with. The internet was best when it was a collection of weird little sites, typos and all, and this is my attempt to recapture just a little bit of that.

Here's to weird little sites! :smile:

## Other stuff

- I opened up my [homelab](https://github.com/blbecker/homelab). I been trying for a while clean up the history (hadn't always been diligent about managing secrets) and decided to just declare bankruptcy and recreate the repo. It's a monorepo of tf configuration, ansible, and flux k8s definitions. I also published a status page for the lab so everyone can know when I'm having a bad time! :sweat_smile:
- Rachel and I took a cruise over the Christmas holiday. It was our first cruise and we had a great time. I plan to post about the trip in more detail, but our [photo album](https://immich.tartarus.us/share/OgqD8Z0nZapJ11eWfhkwhwwrP3T_u8eTlA_GzjxXgoZJFULpU7Nf-ob3dG9vJrO5Vw4) is already published.
- I'm planning on fully migrating off of Dropbox to a self-hosted stack ([Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), [Backrest](https://garethgeorge.github.io/backrest/), [Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage)) and am experimenting with replacing Spotify with [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/). Gotta work on the UX for these things so that they're convenient for the family, but so far things are looking very promising.
