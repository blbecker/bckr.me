summary: A weekend in Columbus, Ohio for the wedding of our friends, Jay and Andra.
---

Rachel and I spent this weekend in Columbus, celebrating the wedding of our friends, Jay and Andra. I've been friends with Jay since we met in high school English class. I was happy to get to spend this time with friends old and new.

In some ways, this trip represented the end of our time in Columbus. We moved in mid-June, but there were a series of events already on the books through the summer and early fall in the midwest. I flew back over July 4th to pack our belongings from the storage unit into moving containers. Rachel returned for a week to attend choir school in Indiana. This trip marks the last of those pre-scheduled returns to Ohio.

While we were here, we also recieved word that our shipment of things from Ohio to San Juan is ready to be dropped off. It's been really interesting observing which things we are most happy to have back (our couch, the server equipment, spoons) and which things we've forgotten about entirely (... :shrug:). Once our things are delivered and we can setup our home, the move should really begin to feel complete. From the point forward, we will be fully in Puerto Rico.
