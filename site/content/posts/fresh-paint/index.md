# Reintroductions

I launched this blog in early 2020. I went into it with grand plans of post with some regularity and sharing a mix of technical and personal content. Those plans haven't changed, but they did get rather postponed. Something else was brewing in early 2020 which, like everyone else, changed the course of my plans. The pandemic ebbed and flowed, a dull drone of anxiety and discomfort punctuated by , and life marched on. I changed jobs, buried my grandfather, and married my best friend. It's been quite a few years and now I'm ready to take another swing at an old-school personal blog.

## Looking Ahead
Well, I'm posting again. I'm loathe to set a specific goal for posting frequency--I want this to stay fun--but I'm putting some intention behind it. I'd like to set a habit of putting some words down regularly. Writing is something I've always enjoyed and that I don't do for myself enough. _Firing off a quick email_ just isn't the same. I'd like to use journaling like this as a way to drive other interests, as well. Preparing technical content is a great way to reflect on things I'm learning and provides an extra incentive to dive into new things. "Inno Days" at work will be great opportunity to build new skills and put together some content.

More mechanically, I've updated the theme on here and updated all of the build tooling. I'll write a more detailed article about the machinery that drives this blog, end to end, but, in brief, a CI pipeline in Github Actions builds the page and uploads it to the server. I've been "maintaining" those actions, but hadn't updated any since 2020. [Hugo Build](https://github.com/blbecker/hugo-build) is now updated to Hugo v0.111.3 and I've added Hugo releases to my RSS reader to help track updates. I'm excited to build out more robust deployment pipelines and get more familiar with Github Actions.

Looking forward to writing more and documenting my traverse.:rocket:
