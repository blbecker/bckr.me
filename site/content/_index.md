## Hello

I'm Benjamin! I'm a software engineer, tinkerer, adventurer, husband, and friend. I live in Ohio with my wife and our four-legged roommates. I work in cloud operations and maintain a small homelab, among many other projects. Outside of tech, I enjoy traveling, scuba, games of all kinds, narrative history, folk-rock and good food. This blog is a collection of projects I'm working on, things I'm thinking about, and notes I'd like to share.
